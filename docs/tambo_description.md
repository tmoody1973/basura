What is Tambo.co?

  Tambo.co is a generative UI framework that creates dynamic, adaptive interfaces based on context. Think of
  it as "smart UI components" that change based on what the user needs.

  How We'll Use Tambo in Budget Explorer

  1. Smart Chat Interface

  Instead of a static chat box, Tambo will:
  - Auto-generate different response formats based on the question
    - Simple text for basic queries
    - Interactive charts when you ask about trends
    - Data tables for detailed breakdowns
    - Comparison views for multi-jurisdiction questions

  2. Adaptive Visualizations

  When you ask "Show me education spending," Tambo will:
  - Automatically choose the best chart type (pie chart, bar graph, etc.)
  - Adjust complexity based on user type:
    - Students get simpler, colorful charts with explanations
    - Journalists get detailed data with export options
    - Citizens get charts focused on personal impact

  3. Dynamic Question Suggestions

  Tambo will generate:
  - Context-aware follow-up questions based on what you're exploring
  - Smart prompts that adapt to the document you're analyzing
  - Learning paths for students that build knowledge progressively

  4. Real-time UI Generation

  As the AI analyzes budgets, Tambo will:
  - Create custom UI elements on the fly
  - Generate comparison panels when needed
  - Build interactive budget explorers
  - Create drill-down interfaces for deep dives

  Example in Action

  Without Tambo:
  - You ask: "Compare city vs county spending"
  - You get: A text response with numbers

  With Tambo:
  - You ask: "Compare city vs county spending"
  - You get:
    - Side-by-side interactive charts
    - Toggleable categories
    - Auto-generated comparison metrics
    - Smart insights highlighting key differences

  The Implementation

  I'll integrate Tambo to:
  1. Enhance the existing chat interface from the v0 mockup
  2. Generate visualizations dynamically based on Mastra.ai responses
  3. Create adaptive UI elements that match user expertise levels
  4. Build interactive components that appear when needed

  Think of Tambo as the "UI brain" that works alongside Mastra.ai (the "analysis brain") to create the
  perfect interface for each question you ask about budget documents.

  In simple terms: Tambo makes the app's interface smart and adaptive - it changes to show information in the
   best way possible based on what you're asking and who you are (student, journalist, or citizen).
