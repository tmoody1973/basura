    fiscalYear: string;
    jurisdictionName: string;
    functionalArea?: string; // e.g., 'public_safety', 'education', 'infrastructure'
    hasTable: boolean;
    tableData?: StructuredTable;
    governmentLevel: number; // 1=federal, 2=state, 3=county, 4=city
  };
  embedding: number[];
}

const multiJurisdictionChunkingConfig = {
  maxChunkSize: 1500,
  minChunkSize: 1000,
  overlapSize: 300,
  preserveStructure: true,
  preserveJurisdictionContext: true,
  tableHandling: 'separate', // Tables processed as individual chunks

    id: chunk.id,
    values: chunk.embedding,
    metadata: {
      content: chunk.content,
      pageNumber: chunk.metadata.pageNumber,
      sectionTitle: chunk.metadata.sectionTitle,
      documentId: chunk.metadata.documentId,
      hasTable: chunk.metadata.hasTable,
      userId: chunk.metadata.userId
    }
  }));
  
  await pineconeIndex.upsert({ vectors });
};
```

#### 6.3.5 Query Processing and Response Generation

**Hybrid Search Implementation**:
```typescript
const performHybridSearch = async (query: string, documentId: string, userId: string) => {
  // Generate query embedding
  const queryEmbedding = await openai.embeddings.create({
    model: 'text-embedding-ada-002',
    input: query
  });

  // Semantic search in Pinecone
  const semanticResults = await pineconeIndex.query({
    vector: queryEmbedding.data[0].embedding,
    topK: 10,
    filter: { documentId, userId },
    includeMetadata: true
  });

  // Keyword-based filtering and ranking
  const keywordFiltered = semanticResults.matches.filter(match => 
    containsRelevantKeywords(match.metadata.content, extractKeywords(query))
  );

  return keywordFiltered.slice(0, 5); // Return top 5 most relevant chunks
};
```

**Response Generation with Citations**:
```typescript
const generateResponseWithCitations = async (context: RetrievedChunk[], query: string) => {
  const contextText = context.map(chunk => 
    `[Page ${chunk.metadata.pageNumber}] ${chunk.metadata.content}`
  ).join('\n\n');

  const prompt = `
    Based on the following budget document excerpts, answer the user's question accurately and comprehensively.
    Always include page number citations in your response.
    
    Context:
    ${contextText}

  `;

  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
    temperature: 0.1 // Low temperature for factual accuracy
  });

  return {
    answer: response.choices[0].message.content,
    citations: context.map(chunk => ({
      pageNumber: chunk.metadata.pageNumber,
      section: chunk.metadata.sectionTitle,
